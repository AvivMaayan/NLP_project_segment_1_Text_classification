We review logistic regression here highlighting the similarities to the matrix-multiplication conception of naive Bayes. Thus, we take the input $\\vect{x}$ to be the bag-of-words representation $bow(\\vect{w})$. But as before you are free to use either implementation approach.\n","\n","## Review of logistic regression\n","\n","Similar to naive Bayes, in logistic regression, we assign a probability to a text $\\vect{x}$ by merely multiplying an $N \\times V$ matrix $\\vect{U}$ by it. However, we don't stipulate that the values in the matrix $\\vect{U}$ be estimated from the training corpus in the \"naive Bayes\" manner. Instead, we allow them to take on any value, using a training regime to select good values.\n","\n","In order to make sure that the output of the matrix multiplication $\\vect{U}\\vect{x}$ is mapped onto a probability distribution, we apply a nonlinear function to renormalize the values. We use the softmax function, a generalization of the sigmoid function from lab 1-4, defined by \n","\n","$$\\softmax(\\vect{z})_i = \\frac{\\exp(z_i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\exp(z_j)}$$\n","\n","for each of the indices $i$ from $1$ to $N$.\n","\n","In summary, we model $\\Prob (y \\given \\vect{x})$ as\n","\n","$$ \\Prob(y_i \\given \\vect{x}) = \\softmax ( \\vect{U} \\vect{x} )_i $$\n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/nlp-course/data/raw/master/Resources/logistic-regression-figure.png\" alt=\"logistic regression illustration\" width=\"400\"  align=right />\n","\n","The calculation of $\\Prob(y \\given \\vect{x})$ for each text $\\vect{x}$ is referred to as the _forward_ computation. In summary, the forward computation for logistic regression involves a linear calculation ($\\vect{U} \\vect{x}$) followed by a nonlinear calculation ($\\softmax$). We think of the perceptron (and more generally many of these neural network models) as transforming from one representation to another. A perceptron performs a linear transformation from the index or bag-of-words representation of the text to a representation as a vector, followed by a nonlinear transformation, a softmax or sigmoid, giving a representation as a probability distribution over the class labels. This single-layer perceptron thus involves two _sublayers_. (In the next part of the project segment, you'll experiment with a multilayer perceptron, with two perceptron layers, and hence four sublayers.)\n","\n","The loss function you'll use is the negative log probability $-\\log \\Prob (y \\given \\vect{x})$. The negative is used, since it is convention to minimize loss, whereas we want to maximize log likelihood. \n","\n","The forward and loss computations are illustrated in the figure at right. In practice, for numerical stability reasons, PyTorch absorbs the softmax operation into the loss function `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`. That is, the input to the `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` function is the vector of sums $\\vect{U} \\vect{x}$ (the last step in the box marked \"your job\" in the figure) rather than the vector of probabilities $\\Prob(y \\given \\vect{x})$. That makes things easier for you (!), since you're responsible only for the first sublayer.\n","\n","Given a forward computation, the weights can then be adjusted by taking a step opposite to the gradient of the loss function. Adjusting the weights in this way is referred to as the _backward_ computation. Fortunately, `torch` takes care of the backward computation for you, just as in lab 1-5.\n","\n","The optimization process of performing the forward computation, calculating the loss, and performing the backward computation to improve the weights is done repeatedly until the process converges on a (hopefully) good set of weights. You'll find this optimization process in the `train_all` method that we've provided. The trained weights can then be used to perform classification on a test set. See the `evaluate` method."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5557c865","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"KEgCwQVHrVw0"},"source":["## Implement the logistic regression classifier\n","\n","For the implementation, we ask you to implement a logistic regression classifier as a subclass of [`torch.nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html#torch.nn.Module). You need to implement the following methods:\n","\n","1. `__init__`: an initializer that takes `text_vocab`, `label_vocab`, and `pad_index` as inputs.\n","\n","    During initialization, you'll want to define a [tensor](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch-tensor) of weights, wrapped in [`torch.nn.Parameter`](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.parameter.Parameter.html#torch.nn.parameter.Parameter), [initialized randomly](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.uniform_), which plays the role of $\\vect{U}$. The elements of this tensor are the parameters of the `torch.nn` instance in the following special technical sense: It is the parameters of the module whose gradients will be calculated and whose values will be updated. Alternatively, **you might find it easier** to use the [`nn.Embedding` module](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.Embedding.html) which is a wrapper to the weight tensor with a lookup implementation.\n","\n","2. `forward`: given a text batch of size `batch_size X max_length`, return a tensor of logits of size `batch_size X num_labels`. That is, for each text $\\vect{x}$ in the batch and each label $y$, you'll be calculating $\\vect{U}\\vect{x}$ as shown in the figure, returning a tensor of these values. Note that the softmax operation is absorbed into [`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html) so you won't need to deal with that.\n","\n","3. `train_all`: A method that performs training.
